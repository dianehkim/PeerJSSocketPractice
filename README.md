# PeerJSSocketPractice
practice using PeerJS and Socket.IO 

installing dependencies:
npm i express ejs socket.io: Express is going to be the server, ejs as our language.
Socket.io allow us to communicate back and forth with the actual server easily.
npm i uuid: uuid allows us to create dynamic URLs.
Having dynamic unique UUIDs for all the different rooms allows users to chat in specific rooms.
npm i --save-dev nodemon: nodemon allows us to quickly refresh our application every single time we make changes so that we do not need to manually restart our server.


running the code:
npm run devStart
peerjs --Port 3001
